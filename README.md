# The-Pig-Game
The pig game is a dice game where players take turns rolling a single die to accumulate points. The goal is to reach a certain number of points (usually 100) before your opponents. However, if a player rolls a 1, they lose all their accumulated points for that turn and the turn passes to the next player.
