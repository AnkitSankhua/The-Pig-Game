# The-Pig-Game

The Pig Game, also known as Pig Dice or Pass the Pigs, is a simple dice game that involves rolling a pair of dice and making strategic decisions to accumulate points. The game is often played with two or more players. The objective of the game is to reach a certain score, usually 100 points, before your opponents do.

Here's a basic description of how the Pig Game is played:

1. Equipment: You need a pair of standard six-sided dice and a way to keep track of scores, such as pen and paper or a digital scoring app.

2. Gameplay:
   - Players take turns rolling the dice.
   - On a player's turn, they roll both dice and the sum of the dice values is added to their current score for that turn.
   - The player can choose to roll the dice as many times as they want in a single turn, accumulating points with each roll. However, there's a risk involved: if a player rolls a "1" on one or both dice, their current turn's score becomes zero and their turn ends. They lose all the points they had accumulated during that turn.
   - If a player chooses to stop rolling before rolling a "1," they can choose to "hold" and add the current turn's score to their total score. After this, their turn ends and they pass the dice to the next player.

3. Winning the Game:
   - Players take turns rolling and accumulating points until one player reaches the pre-determined winning score, usually 100 points.
   - Once a player reaches or exceeds the winning score at the end of their turn, the game ends and that player is declared the winner.

4. Strategy:
   - The game involves a balance of risk and reward. Players must decide whether to continue rolling for a chance to earn more points in a single turn or to play it safe and hold onto their current score.
   - It's crucial to manage the risk of rolling a "1" and losing all accumulated points for the turn.

The Pig Game is often played in a friendly and social setting, and it can be enjoyed by players of all ages. It's a great game for practicing basic math skills and making strategic decisions. Variations and house rules can be added to increase the complexity and fun of the game. Some variations Include Piggyback , Two-Die Pig , Roll or Pay , Stealing Points etc....
